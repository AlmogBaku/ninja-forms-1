# Milestones

Milestones measure a user's level of engagement with Ninja Forms using metrics such as Form Count, Submissions Count, and the number of times a form is displayed.

As each Milestone is reached a new [Admin Notice](includes/Admin/Notices.php) is registered requesting the user's feedback.
