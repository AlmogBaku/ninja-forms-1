    <h1>Congratulations!</h1>
    <h2>You are elgible to update to Ninja Forms THREE!</h2>

    <p>You are only moments away from the biggest thing to ever happen to the WordPress form building experience.</p>

    <p>Ninja Forms THREE is the most <em>intuitive</em>, <em>powerful</em>, and <em>enjoyable</em> form builder you will ever use.</p>

    <h2>Before you update, we want to make you aware of a few <strong>very important points:</stong></h2>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>This is a pre-release.</strong>
          <p>We have tested everything we can and consider this release ready, but if you have any issues please report them via the "Get Help" item in the "Forms" menu.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Calculations will not convert.</strong>
          <p>Any forms with calculations will be converted to Ninja Forms THREE, but calculations within those forms will need recreated as a result of our vastly improved calculations system.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>We have resources to help you with the transition to THREE.</strong>
          <p>The Ninja Forms THREE documentation, development process, FAQ, and more <a href='http://ninjaforms.com/three/'>can be found here.</a></p>
      </li>
    </ol>
